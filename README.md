## Bayesian Inference: Fitting Mixed Effects Nonlinear Models with ODEs in Stan, Focused on Pharmacometrics

This tutorial guides you through fitting Mixed Effects Nonlinear Models combined with Differential Equations (ODEs) using Stan in R. Developed in the lab of Joshua Weitz under the supervision of Jeremy Seurat, this resource is designed for those interested in advanced Bayesian modeling, particularly in the field of pharmacometrics.

Stan, a powerful Bayesian programming language created by Andrew Gelman and colleagues in 2012, uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) algorithms. These methods are known for their efficiency in exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces, making Stan ideal for tackling complex models and large datasets.

In this tutorial, you'll learn to:

Simulate data
Perform Bayesian inference
Analyze model fit
These steps will equip you with essential skills for applying Bayesian inference to dynamic systems.

## Getting Started
To begin, use the R and Stan files provided in this repository. They will guide you through each step of the process.
