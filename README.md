# Stan-Tutorial
Bayesian Inference: fitting mixed effects non linear models combined with ODEs on Stan, focus on pharmacometrics. Joshua Weitz's Lab, realized under Jeremy Seurat's supervising.

This tutorial aims to fit Mixed Effects Nonlinear Models with Differential Equations using Stan in R. Stan is a highly advanced Bayesian programming language developed in 2012 by Andrew Gelman and his colleagues. Stan employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the No-U-Turn Sampler algorithms, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces, making it well-suited for complex models and large datasets.

We will explore the power of Stan as we simulate data, perform Bayesian inference, and analyze the model fit, providing you with essential skills for Bayesian modeling in dynamic systems.

The user is invited to use the two R and stan files available in this github.
